[Intro]

  When I started interacting with Rarity, I immediately fantasized about playing a 3D physics third-person D&D-themed game with support for importing Rarity's summoner stats. PrismoRarity is an open source test intended for us to take our characters for a spin against monsters in an open world that grows over time, and where we can witness the impact of our weapons and spells. This project is inactive because I do not have the time to develop it.
